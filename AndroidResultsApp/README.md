# AndroidAppCeeSharp
Simple C# and Xamarin application.
A consistent Gradle script issue and SDK issues in Android Studio caused me to switch Android App development to Visual Studio. 
This is a translator application that converts a word in a phone number, into the actual phone number needed to call.
Ex. 1-855-XAM-ARIN becomes 1-855-926-2746. 
Ex. 1-800-got-milk becomes 1-800-468-6455.
Ex. 1-800-npm-runn becomes 1-800-676-7866.

This app requires knowledge of C# and Xamarin forms.
